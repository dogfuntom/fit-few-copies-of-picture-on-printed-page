== development

"We feel the best way to become a well-rounded and highly-capable web developer is to focus first on learning what the web platform has to offer with as few frameworks and tools added on top as possible."
-- https://modern-web.dev[Modern Web], "`https://modern-web.dev/guides/going-buildless[Going Buildless]`" https://modern-web.dev/guides/going-buildless/getting-started/[¬ß Getting Started] (https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/blob/8c0250c6d844767896360d083e743c5a3edc502a/docs/guides/going-buildless/getting-started.md[permalink])

This repo is intended to be a sample project about:

* https://modern-web.dev/guides/going-buildless[buildless] (i.e. w/o Node.js or Deno or Bun) small-scale static web dev
* supporting `+file://+` a.k.a. menu:File[Open File...] a.k.a. kbd:[Ctrl+O] (namely, this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#troubleshooting[is not compatible with modules], unfortunately)
* applying drastic changes to printed version (a.k.a. `+@media print+`)
* having use for the notoriously ‚Äúshunned‚Äù `+reset+` button
* and--to a small extent--validation, allowing scale-up in `+flex+` in `+grid+`, `+IntersectionObserver+`, `+<output>+`, print margins, units of length, etc.

See also: xref:./implementation notes{outfilesuffix}[].

== limitations

* PWA support is, technically, not fully to specificaton--"`a user agent MAY ignore it`" and if it does, the user will see the root of account's GitHub Pages (which is horribly extraneous)
* accessibility is untested (meant to be hopefully serviceable to sighted screen reader users, partially sighted, etc.)
